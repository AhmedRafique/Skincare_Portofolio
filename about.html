            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Aura Skincare was born from a passion for nature and a belief in the power of pure ingredients. We started in a small kitchen, experimenting with organic botanicals and cold-pressed oils, driven by a simple mission: to create skincare that is both gentle on the skin and kind to the planet.</p>
            <p>We believe that what you put on your body is as important as what you put in it. That's why we are committed to using only the highest quality, ethically sourced ingredients. Our formulas are free from harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances, and unnecessary additives. Every product is a testament to our dedication to purity, efficacy, and transparency.</p>
            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Our philosophy is simple: skincare should be a ritual of self-care, not a chore. It's about nourishing your skin and soul. We craft our products to provide a luxurious, sensory experience that leaves you feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and radiant.</p>
